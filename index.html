Dear Dani,

Happy Birthday, Dani! I know we’re not talking right now, and I respect the space you need. Pero ngayon, hindi ko hahayaan na hindi kita mabati sa bday mo. I remember the first time we met sa roblox (I know it was so random HAHAHA). Every moment with you felt special, even in silence. Your giggle was my favorite sound (miss kona naman). The way you care and pray for others is so inspiring para saken. I cherished our late-night talks kahit through call lang yon, masaya na’ko. You taught me the true meaning of love and patience. Even in our disagreements, I learned and grew. Your strength and kindness is giving talaga. I miss the way we understood each other. Your presence brought peace to my chaotic world, like literal (ngayon nalulungkot ako:) ). I often find myself reminiscing about sa atin since namimiss konga ikaw and mga pinag gagawa natin HAHAHA. Your support during tough times meant everything to me. I admired your passion and dedication to your dreams. Your intelligence always amazed me (hayaan mo yang mga cheater na mas nahihigitan pa grades mo. Ikaw lang magaling para saken;). I miss the way you made ordinary days extraordinary. You had the power to brighten my darkest days. I often wonder how you're doing and if you're happy. I hope life is treating you kindly. I wish I could turn back time to relive our happiest moments. But I understand that things have changed. I respect your decision and the space you've asked for. Please know that my feelings for you remain unchanged. I will always cherish the love we shared. You will forever hold a special place in my heart (like what you want). I hope you find the happiness and peace you deserve. If our paths cross again, I will welcome it with open arms. Until then, I will carry the memories of us with me. Thank you for the love and joy you brought into my life. I hope your birthday brings you as much happiness as you brought me. May all your dreams and wishes come true. You deserve nothing but the best. I will always be grateful for the time we spent together. You are unforgettable. I loved your presence, your voice, your eyes, your words. I miss the version of me I was when I was with you. I’d be lying if I said I don’t think about us. You were the safest place I had. No one will ever be able to take your place. Loving you was one of the most beautiful chapter of my life. You taught me how deep love could be. And that’s something I’ll carry forever. I hope you smile today — a real smile. I hope you’re surrounded by love. If this is truly goodbye, then thank you — for everything. You’ll always be my once-in-a-lifetime.
Remember, dani, I’ll always be rooting for you. I hope you appreciate this simple gift that I’ve made. Can’t lie, I was tearing up while doing this hehe.

With all my love,  
Gene
